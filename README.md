AFMActionSheet provides a AFMActionSheetController that can be used in places where one would use a UIAlertController, but a customized apperance or custom presentation/dismissal animation is needed. Seeing as how AFMActionSheetController was inspired by UIAlertController, it too supports ActionSheet and Alert styles to make your life even easier.

## Usage
To create an action sheet with default style and default transition animations:
```swift
let actionSheet = AFMActionSheetController()
let action = AFMAction(title: "Action", enabled: true, handler: { (action: AFMAction) -> Void in
    // Do something in handler
}
actionSheet.addAction(action)
self.presentViewController(actionSheet, animated: true, completion: {
    // Do something after completion
})
```
That's it.

## Detailed look
### Style
AFMActionSheetController supports two styles: the default action sheet style and alert style. These are set via initializers with `ControllertStyle` enum (`ControllertStyle.ActionSheet` and `ControllertStyle.Alert` accordingly)
```swift
let actionSheet = AFMActionSheetController(style: .ActionSheet)
let alert = AFMActionSheetController(style: .Alert)
```

### Transitioning animations
To change presentation and dismissal animations, implement a `UIViewControllerTransitioningDelegate` and pass it to AFMActionSheetController
```swift
let actionSheet = AFMActionSheetController(transitioningDelegate: myCustomTransitioningDelegate)
```
or
```swift
actionSheet.setupTranstioningDelegate(myCustomTransitioningDelegate)
```

### Action controls
Action sheet's controls are created by adding `AFMAction` objects to the controller
```swift
actionSheet.addAction(action)
```
It is also possible to add actions as "Cancel actions". When using `ControllertStyle.ActionSheet` style, controls for these actions will be displayed in the bottom "Cancel section".
```swift
actionSheet.addCancelAction(action)
```
To use custom views as action controls just pass the view with action to `addAction` or `addCancelAction` method
```swift
actionSheet.addAction(action, control: myCustomControl)
actionSheet.addCancelAction(action, control: myCustomControl)
```
Height of the action control is whatever height passed custom view specifies, but it is possible to specify minimal control height with `minControlHeight` property.

### Title view
Title view is a view that is located on top of the action sheet and works similar to action controls.
To set the title view with custom view
```swift
actionSheet.addTitleView(myCustomTitleView)
```
or to set a default `UILabel` with a text
```swift
actionSheet.addTitle("Title")
```
Like with action control height, it is possible to specify minimal control height with `minTitleHeight` property.

### Other customizations
There is a number of properties to help further modify the look and behavior of action sheet controller:

- `spacing: Int` specifies content's spacing between action controls (default is `4`)
- `horizontalMargin: Int` specifies spacing from content to controller's top and bottom (default is `16`)
- `verticalMargin: Int` specifies spacing from content to controller's  left and right (default is `16`)
- `cornerRadius: Int` specifies corner radius of content (default is `10`)
- `backgroundColor: UIColor` specifies controller's background color (default is `blackColor().colorWithAlphaComponent(0.5)`)
- `spacingColor: UIColor` specifies content's spacing color (default is `.clearColor()`)
- `outsideGestureShouldDismiss: Bool` specifies whether the click on background outside of controls and title dismisses action sheet (default is `true`)
