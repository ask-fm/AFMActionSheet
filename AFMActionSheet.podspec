                       Easily adaptable action sheet supporting custom views and transitions.
                       AFMActionSheet provides a AFMActionSheetController that can be used in places where one would use a UIAlertController, but a customized apperance or custom presentation/dismissal animation is needed. Seeing as how AFMActionSheetController was inspired by UIAlertController, it too supports ActionSheet and Alert styles to make your life even easier.
